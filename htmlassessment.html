<p>Formula 1 is the highest form of single seater racing and often refered to as the peak of motorsport. F1 is a world wide sport with more than 20 different races across the globe.</p>
<p>F1 drivers are also some of the best drivers on the planet. The cars are fast and incredibly tricky to drive. The cars can pull up to 6g's in the corners which is almost as much as a fighter pilot.  </p>
<p>The Formula stands for the regulations that the teams need to build their cars around. Currently there are 10 teams with 2 drivers each. The drivers work together to get as many points as possible but they still want to beat each other.</p>
<p>At the end of the year the driver with the most points after all races will be the World Champion. The teams combine both their drivers points together and the team with the most points will be the Contstructors World Champion</p>
